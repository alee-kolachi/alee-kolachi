# Hi — I’m Alee 👋
**Entrepreneur · Machine Learning / NLP Engineer**  
Focusing on PyTorch, Hugging Face, and production-ready NLP solutions.

---

## About Me
- Building practical ML & NLP solutions using **PyTorch**, **Hugging Face**, and modern pipelines.
- I combine hands-on engineering with product focus — from model training to integrations and deployment.
- Current interests: transformer fine-tuning, inference optimization, IR & retrieval-augmented generation (RAG), and model evaluation.

---

## Tech & Tools
- **Languages:** Python, JavaScript, HTML/CSS, Java
- **ML / NLP:** PyTorch, Hugging Face Transformers, tokenizers, datasets, spaCy
- **Infra & DevOps:** Docker, GitHub Actions, REST APIs
- **Other:** Firebase (auth), web dev fundamentals

---

## Pinned projects
(Selected repos from my profile — more in my repositories.)
- **image-recognition-and-file-organization** — practical image classification + local file organization pipeline.  
- **Skrill-Page** — frontend page using HTML & CSS.  
- **simple-login-signup-firebase-auth** — demo of Firebase Authentication (login/signup flow).  
- **ScrapeAPI** — scraping API for structured biographical data.  
- **my-android-projects** — Android practice projects.  

*(See my repositories for details and code examples.)*

---

## Work & Contributions
- I’m building and experimenting with fine-tuning transformer models and inference workflows for real applications.
- I contribute code and experiments in repositories that explore image recognition, scraping, and auth integration patterns.

## Quick roadmap
- Short-term: publish a Hugging Face demo notebook and a PyTorch fine-tuning example with README and inference guide.  
- Medium-term: add CI / Actions for model tests and bring a minimal deployment example (Docker + FastAPI).

If you'd like, I can also:
- Add a one-click demo badge (Hugging Face Space or binder) for a specific repo.
- Produce a short example notebook README for a PyTorch+HF fine-tuning pipeline.
